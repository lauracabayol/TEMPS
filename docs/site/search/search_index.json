This repository contains a neural network to predict photometric redshifts. The neural network incorporates domain adaptation, a methodology to mitigate the impact of sample bias in the spectroscopic training samples. </p> <p>The training and validation data are not available in the repository, but the model can be trained with new data. The model is also deployed and available here.

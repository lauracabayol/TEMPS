This repository contains a neural network to predict photometric redshifts. The neural network incorporates domain adaptation, a methodology to mitigate the impact of sample bias in the spectroscopic training samples.

The model is deployed and available [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lauracabayol/TEMPS) (WiP). The model in production enables making predictions for new galaxies with the pretrained models. One can also run the code locally
```bash
python app.py
```
This opens a Gradio interface to make predictions for new galaxies.

Documentation is available [here](https://lauracabayol.github.io/TEMPS/).

## Installation

You will also need to clone the repository to your local environment by executing the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lauracabayol/TEMPS
cd TEMPS
```
## Installation

We recommend using a conda environment with Python 3.10 by executing the following commands:
```bash
conda create -n temps -c conda-forge python=3.10
conda activate temps
```
Once your environment is ready, proceed with the installation of the package:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
This will already install the dependencies.

## Notebooks

The repository contains notebooks to reproduce the figures in the paper (TBD)
The notebooks are loaded on GitHub as .py files. To convert them to .ipynb use <jupytext>

```bash
jupytext --to ipynb notebooks/*.py
```

## Usage

The model can be trained using the train.py script at the repo main directory.

```bash
python scripts/train.py --config-file data/config.yml
```
More information on the training script can be found in the [docs](https://lauracabayol.github.io/TEMPS/docs/docs/index.html)

To make predictions for new galaxies, you can use the predict.py script (TBD).
